# Create Your Own Scaffold 
# Project 3: Midterm Prep

Each team is responsible for creating their own website scaffold consisting of PSD file(s), HTML and CSS files. The scaffold will be based off of the wireframes selected from each partner. 

With our newly merged wireframe design, we have blocked in our index/Home page as well as our About page. With our design, the main focus was to provide users with the most information about the TRAA as possible. People can get a feel for the organization and learn about this tight-knit community even before attending a meeting themselves. By including photos of events and even the headshot lists, users of the site can identify some group members in photos which can allow for easier introductions.
